## 🌟 Bottom Line and Notes

This is not to be used for your "projects" this is a development tool only. Indium was made by developers for developers so if you are a skid then leave.
Please star and share the discord server around. I will really appreciate it! ALSO please note that this is NOT finished and constantly going under development therefore be patient.

Cheers!
