## 💭 Get In Touch

You can report bugs or ask for help by joining the official Indium Discord here: https://discord.gg/qEZEADqsbX


## 🌟 Bottom Line and Notes

This is not to be used for your "projects" this is a development tool only. Indium was made by developers for developers so if you are a skid then leave.
Please star and share the discord server around. I will really appreciate it! ALSO please note that this is NOT finished and constantly going under development therefore report any bugs in the discord
and be patient for bug fixes and new updates.

Cheers!
