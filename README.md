Indium Launcher can basically run any fortnite version freely, basically error free.

Indium is for testing purposes only. Not to host YET.

Indium is used to test things such as:

paks (maybe)
gameservers (find in settings)
dlls (auto inject in settings)
backend development testing (settings)
and much more!

HOW TO SETUP INDIUM


1.) download the file.
2.) extract it.
3.) find it and open with visual studio.
4.) [PLACEHOLDER-UNFINISHED]
5.) click debug (or release) at the top and make sure its on release, then press start.
6.) head to the bin file of the Indium Launcher and find IndiumLauncher.exe and run it.
7.) once in the launcher, head over to libary and either download or import your build.
8.) if you dont know what build to download head over to the patch notes tab, will tell you patch notes for all versions displayed in launcher.
9.) once downloaded or imported click launch (verify files if imported to be safe!)
10.) enjoy!

(DISCORD AT TOP)


Also just a heads up this is not to be used for your "projects" this is a development tool only.
Indium was made by developers for developers so if you are a skid then leave.

Please star and share the discord server around. I will really appreciate it!


Cheers!
