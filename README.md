# ℹ️ Infomation


This launcher was made to use old fortnite files and launch them and test development usage for public servers. At the moment, there is no way we can support loading into games without 
YOU the developer making that yourself by going to the settings page on the launcher and inputting the "Gameserver" as it should be empty for Indium V1.00. The backend should just be
LawinServer V2.

I made this launcher to get rid of me just having to use reboot which for me was a pain in my ass, therefore developed this testing product. I decided to make it public because people
are out there that are in need of something fresh and something new. To my knowledge this has not been done before. I know in Reboot you can use your own backend and gameserver but the
launcher looks trash and sometimes its a pain to setup. (no disrespect intended, its a brilliant piece of software). Therefore I decided to develope and publish Indium.

After all the "slack" I just gave to Reboot you can join their discord here.

## 🚀 Usage

Indium is used to test and help the further development of the following:


paks (maybe)

gameservers (find in settings)

dlls (auto inject in settings, therefore the development of cheats will be allowed, but not advised.)

backend development testing (settings)

## 🌟 Bottom Line and Notes

This is not to be used for your "projects" this is a development tool only. Indium was made by developers for developers so if you are a skid then leave.
Please star and share the discord server around. I will really appreciate it! ALSO please note that this is NOT finished and constantly going under development therefore be patient.

Cheers!
